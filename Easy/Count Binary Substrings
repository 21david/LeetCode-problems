        A brute force approach would be to check all substrings of size 2, then size 3,
        until the subtring reaches the size of the whole string. I think this would be
        O(N^2) complexity, which would probably not pass the time limit.
        
        Another approach would be to check all substrings of size 2, and when a substring
        that matches the pattern is found, store the index of that substring somewhere.
        Once the whole string is iterated through, we should have a list of all the size 2
        substrings that match, and any other substrings that match will start from these.
        So, for each substring of size 2, we can try to expand as much as we can, counting any
        new substrings that we find. Once we've tried all the substrings, we should have
        a count of all the substrings (of all sizes) that match the pattern in the description.
